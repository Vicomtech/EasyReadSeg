# EasyReadSeg

EasyReadSeg is a corpus of Easy Read segmented text based on original content published in Irekia (https://www.irekia.euskadi.eus/), Inclusion Europe (https://www.inclusion-europe.eu/) and Plena Inclusión (https://www.plenainclusion.org). Its aim is to foster research on Easy Read text generation and covers three languages: Basque, English and Spanish.

**NOTE:** As of this writing, we have secured permission to publicly share only a subset of the data under the specified license, namely the Basque data subsets from Irekia. We have not yet been authorised to share the English and Spanish data from Inclusion Europe and Plena Inclusión, respectively. Contact us if you would like to use these datasets for your own private research.

The corpus was created during the development of project IRAZ (ZL-2024/00570), which received funding from the Department of Economic Development and Competitiveness of the Basque Government (Spri Group), within the Hazitek programme (2022-2024). 

## Format and usage

The data are provided as UTF-8 text files with one sentence per line. The original segmentation is indicated in the text with the inlined symbol *\_seg\_*.
